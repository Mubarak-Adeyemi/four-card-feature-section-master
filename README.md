## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned to effectively use CSS Grid for building responsive
layouts. I also gained a better understanding of media queries, ensuring my
design adapts well to different screen sizes. Hereâ€™s a sample of my media query
implementation:

```css
@media (min-width: 769px) {
  .tools-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
    grid-template-areas:
      "supervisor team-builder calculator"
      "supervisor karma calculator";
    align-items: center;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I aim to continue improving my understanding of responsive design principles and
CSS Grid layouts. In future projects, I plan to explore more advanced animations
and further optimize layouts for smaller devices.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) -
  This is an amazing article that thoroughly explains CSS Grid, and it helped me
  implement the layout in this project.
- [Automatic CSS Documentation on Text & Heading Line Length](https://automaticcss.com/docs/text-heading-line-length/#:~:text=CSS%2Dbased%20line%20length%20caps&text=We%20do%20this%20by%20setting,it%27s%20more%20or%20less%20accurate.) -
  This resource helped me better understand text and heading length limitations
  and best practices.
